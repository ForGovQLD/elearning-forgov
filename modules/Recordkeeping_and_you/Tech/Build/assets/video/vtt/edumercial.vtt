00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.120
In our rapidly changing world, 

2
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.080
understanding the collective power of individual positive actions

3
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.360
is more important than ever.

4
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.880
As we go about our daily lives we may not realise it,

5
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.120
but our future is more determined by the predictable,

6
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.840
little actions that we all take every day,

7
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.520
than the big external forces that shape our world.

8
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.520
Small actions now create 

9
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.760
big results in the future.

10
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.360
There are many examples where this plays out, 

11
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.000
but let's take a look at recycling – something that many of us do every day.

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.040
In Queensland in 2016,

13
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.240
more than 500,000 tonnes of recyclable materials were saved 

14
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.200
from going to landfill

15
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.880
through the everyday simple efforts of separating our rubbish

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.080
 into separate bins.

17
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.880
Just to put that in perspective, 

18
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.560
that's the equivalent of 6304 Humpback whales or 68 Eiffel towers, 

19
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.080
or 352 of the world's

20
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.880
largest ever rocket! The small collective efforts of many people working 

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.680
together can really add up!

22
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.320
Recordkeeping is a bit like that too.

23
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.000
It takes a few minutes out of your day,

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and it's everyone's responsibility to do their bit.

25
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.800
The small efforts that you take to make and keep 

26
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.160
accurate records benefit all of us.

27
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.520
It benefits you as an individual, 

28
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.680
because when you make a record you can refer to it later.

29
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.000
It benefits your team and your agency, 

30
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.200
as information can be shared and reused across the organisation.

31
00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.120
It creates a more transparent and accountable Government. 

32
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.240
And at a wider level, it benefits Queenslanders, 

33
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.040
both now and into the future and

34
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.760
It creates a collection of data and information 

35
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.760
that future Queenslanders can access

36
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.360
and use in ways that we can't even imagine right now.

37
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Making and keeping records may not seem like a high priority- after all, 

38
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.760
you can remember what you've done,

39
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.120
you can always check with your colleagues 

40
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.520
if you need to get the full picture from your team,

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.120
and you're not clear if it's your role anyway.

42
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.080
Let's look forward into the near future- say just one year from now.

43
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.360
Your recollection of what you did today's not so clear. 

44
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.080
Some key colleagues have moved on, 

45
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.800
and you're looking for information to do your job.

46
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.560
Now it takes quite a bit of time to go back and try to search for information 

47
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.560
about the work you're doing today.

48
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.760
Without recordkeeping, some pieces of the puzzle are missing.

49
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.840
Now let's fast forward far into the future. 

50
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.280
We don't know exactly how many generations to come 

51
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.760
will use the records we're keeping now.

52
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.000
But we trust that they will need them, and when they do, 

53
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.040
the complete story (records and contextual information) will be available.

54
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.040
Recordkeeping is something you have to do as part of your job,

55
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.760
so you may be wondering, Why do I need to make and keep records?

56
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.360
What is the value of creating and keeping records?

57
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.040
How to Make, Keep and Dispose of Records?

58
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.160
We've created an eLearning module that is designed to help 

59
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.160
you make sense of recordkeeping.

60
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.040
It's called ‘Recordkeeping and You'. We know you're busy.

61
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.640
It's just 10 minutes.

62
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.400
You can do it anywhere, anytime. 

63
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.360
Check it out on your phone, tablet or computer.

64
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.760
It's practical. This is a really great use of your time.

65
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.760
We guarantee that this training will save you more than 10 minutes

66
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.160
through more efficient recordkeeping.

67
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.000
Do you know?

68
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.480
The dollar figure if all public employees spend 5 minutes a day 

69
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.680
looking for a record is upwards of $500,000 per day!

70
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.400
So, visit the Queensland Government recordkeeping 

71
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.000
website for more information and resources.

72
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.120
Recordkeeping. Small actions now create big results in the future. 

73
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.120
It's worth your time.
